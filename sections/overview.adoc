== Getting started 

To quickly start write mobile enabled Workflow Managment applications please follow our guides:

- link:./guides/wfm.html[WFM Guide] 
Getting Started for Workflow Management Solutions.

- link:./guides/framework.html[Framework Guide] 
Getting Started with {ProductName} core components.

== Introduction

{ProductName}  consist of set of node.js modules written in TypeScript language that are packaged and distributed as 
{ProductName} provides a set of reusable components that can simplify mobile, web and cloud application development.
Solution allows developers to write secure, offline ready websites and mobile applications.
{ProductName} provides Workforce Managment oriented framework for Workforce Management applications.

Solution consist of two fully independent frameworks:
 * Workflow Managment Framework
 * Rapid Application Development Framework

As extension to frameworks above {ProductName} provides set of example module implementations as part of demo applications. 

===  Workflow Managment Framework 

{ProductName} Workflow Managment Framework build BPMN compliant workflow management solution.
WFM framework allows to build advanced Business Process Management solutions. 
Framework helps to write solutions that connects a business back-office with its fleet of mobilized employees.

 * Task: defines single unit of work for business process
 * Flow: contain ordered set of tasks and handlers for executing tasks in proper order
 * Process: instance of flow containing current progress and business objects.

Users can write custom Tasks (Workflow Steps) that will implement any business logic and link implementation with any UI solution.
Framework abstract from any web or mobile application libraries, allowing developers to focus on impmentation of the process. 

===  Rapid Application Development Framework

{ProductName} Rapid Application Development Framework allows to build production-grade Node.js and Cordova based applications.

Main targets for framework:

* Rapid, production ready application development framework.
* Covers Mobile, web and server side application development
* Written in TypeScript (with support JavaScript development)
* Secure out of the box thanks to multiple security providers (Keycloak, Passport.js)
* Full support for offline enabled applications thanks to FeedHenry Sync
* Extensibility provided by set of TypeScript based interfaces
* Provide A sleek, modern, mobile enabled front-end reference applications
* Provides abstraction layer for common application elements:
    ** Data access 
    ** Security
    ** Logging 
    ** Restfull API creation 
    ** Unit testing

Framework abstract from any application logic and technologies allowing developers to extend it for their needs.

===  Demo application

- Set of example implementations for Workflow Managment Solutions (Workorder, WorkorderResult)
- Website, Mobile and server demo applications serving as reference implementation for the framework.

=== RainCatcher module relationships

===  Module structure

RainCatcher modules are written in [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org).

The main files are modules that by default export a class containing the main implementation for the module's intent,with a named export containing a public interface that should be depended upon, and reimplemented.

```typescript
import Implementation, { PublicInterface } from '@raincatcher/module';
```

=== Default exports

Each module exports by default an implementation and set of interfaces by name.
Default implementation will usually implement most common use case for module.
Along with the default export, all modules include a public interface definition that are depended upon by other RainCatcher modules instead of depending on the implementation itself.
