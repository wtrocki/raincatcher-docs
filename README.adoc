== Using the Repository

=== Downstream and Upstream

The downstream folder is _rhmap_.

The upstream folder is _upstream-1_.

The _topics_ folder contains *.adoc* files which are shared between the _rhmap_ and _upstream-1_ folder.

The _rhmap_ and _upstream-1_ folder have access to the _topics_ folder via a symbolic link.

=== Building the Community Edition

The *master.adoc* file is the only file to build when rendering the files into text.
Build the example located in the _upstream-1_ folder:

    gem install asciidoctor
    git checkout gh-pages
    cd docs/workforce-management-framework/upstream-1
    asciidoctor master.adoc
    cp master.html ../../../index.html
    git commit -a -m"Pages update"
    git push origin +gh-pages
    
=== Creating Anchors and xrefs

==== Dynamic Anchor and Dynamic xref
An anchor (for example: [[Testing the App]]) cannot appear more than once in an *.adoc* file.
As Modular Doc files are regularly reused in the same *.adoc* file, this results in a build error.
See link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-multiple[Including Multiple Anchors] to negate this issue.

==== Dynamic Anchors and Hard-Coded xref

There are occasions when a dynamic xref (for example: xref:ref-logging-{chapter}) will have to be hard coded (for example: xref:ref-logging-user-_story-a_)

This happens when:

* the value inserted at build time for "{chapter}" is set in *User Story A* - the value for "{chapter}" being (:chapter: user-story-_a_)
* *User Story B* includes the module which contains the anchor "[id='ref-logging-{chapter}']" that the xref points to, and the "{chapter}" value being (:chapter: user-story-_b_)
* when *master.adoc* is built, "xref:ref-logging-user-story-_a_" _does not exist_ however "xref:ref-logging-user-story-_b_" _does exist_
 
The solution is a hard-coded xref:

* for the "xref:ref-logging-{chapter}" being set in *User Story A*
* hard code the xref, that is, "xref:ref-logging-user-story-_b_"
* when *master.adoc* is built, "xref:ref-logging-user-story-_b_" _does exist_
 
NOTE: If an xref is used to point to an anchor in a module, and the module itself is not built as part of *master.adoc* - this will cause an error.

== Contributing Documentation Content

=== Books, Chapters, User Stories and Modular Docs

The _rhmap_ and _upstream-1_ folder posses their own version of the *master.adoc* file - this is the Book.

The Chapters are found within the Book (*master.adoc*).
They are simply headings.
Each Chapter will contain one to many User Stories.

In *master.adoc*, the User Stories are formed using references to Modular Doc *.adoc* files.
The structure of the User Story is defined with headings and the structure is based on an link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Assembly template(TEMPLATE_ASSEMBLY.adoc)].

Modular Docs are *.adoc* files and contain the content and are primarily located in the _topics_ folder.
Modular Docs are imported into the User Stories.
There are 3 types of Modular Docs, for more information, see xref:modular-docs[Types of Modular Docs].

=== Writing a User Story, *not* a Feature

IMPORTANT: It is vital that content is created with a User Story in mind

A Feature describes all available features - it is comprehensive.

A User Story explains how to achieve a specific goal - it is selective.

In a user story-based world, docs describe, for example, how to make an omelette (using onions and eggs).

Modular Docs are used to construct the User Story.

[[modular-docs]]
=== Modular Docs
A User Story is created using the 3 types of Modular Docs:

==== Concept
A concept module describes and explains things such as a product, subsystem, or feature — what a customer needs to understand to do a task.
A concept module may also explain how things relate and interact with other things.
The use of graphics and diagrams can speed up understanding of a concept.

.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Concept template (TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_concept_template_and_guidelines.adoc)]

==== Procedure
A Procedure module is a procedure written with numbered steps — what a customer needs to do to accomplish a goal successfully.
This paragraph explains why the user performs the task, sets the context of the task, and may explain or list specical considerations specific to this task.
Keep the information brief and focused on what is needed for this specific task.
Suggested length is 1 to 3 sentences, can be longer if needed.

.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Procedure template (TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing_one_procedure.adoc)]

==== Reference
A reference module lists things (such as a list of commands) or has a very regimented structure (such as the consistent structure of man pages).
A reference module explains the details that a customer needs to know to do a task.
A reference module is well-organized if users can scan it to quickly find the details they want.

=== Example of a User Story constructed using Modular Docs

In a user story-based world, docs describe, for example, how to make an omelette (using onions and eggs).

* Making an Onion Omelette
. Setting up Workplace
. Preparing Ingredients
. Selecting Spices
. Combining Ingredients
. Frying Omelette Mixture
. Serving the Omelette
. Other Onion Recipes

Using this example, the structure of the User Story would be:
----
├── making-an-onion-omelette.adoc         (Assembly)
│   ├── include: con-making-an-onion-melette.adoc  (Concept)
│   ├── include: pro-setting-up-workplace.adoc     (Procedure)
│   ├── include: pro-preparing-ingredients.adoc    (Procedure)
│   ├── include: pro-selecting-spices.adoc         (Procedure)
│   ├── include: pro-combining-ingredients.adoc    (Procedure)
│   ├── include: pro-frying-omelette-mixture.adoc  (Procedure)
│   ├── include: pro-serving-the-omelette.adoc     (Procedure)
│   ├── include: ref-other-onion-recipes.adoc      (Reference)
